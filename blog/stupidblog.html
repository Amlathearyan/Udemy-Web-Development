	<h1>when</h1>
	<p>I don’t know how to tell you I’m broken, without feeling needy
I don’t know how to open up, without feeling judged
I don’t know how to cry when my tears have burnt me from inside.
I just need you to see that I’m broken, without me telling you
because my mouth shuts the words coming out, waiting for you to shake me up and make me fine
although I know that’s not your job and you’re better off without me
I just need you to see me one last time
WHEN? before its too late to reconcile.
I feel empty, yet so full of emotion, Like the smallest thing could push me over the edge
I can still smile at pretty things and laugh when jokes are funny
I can still find the light and enjoy the nice days
But when I go inside, when I am alone, there is something broken
and I fall into a sadness so sweet, that it engulfs me
I look into the mirror and i don’t like what I  see
and the tears always fall, when I’m falling asleep
I need to know myself, once in a while
WHEN? before I’m back to being a self-destructing juvenile
I tell myself nobody can ever love me, because it’s easier than admitting someone might
It’s easier to believe you need no one, than to hold on to the hope that someday you might
It’s so much easier to believe that you’re cracked, than to believe you’re whole
and it’s so much easier to guard your heart from the very start, than let someone in, and give it the chance of being broke
The reality strikes and it terrifies you, that someone would love you someday
and it will be more terrifiying than being alone everyday
I need to love myself, once in a while
WHEN? before my life turns hostile
I understood what distance was when I said I am all good, and you believed it to be true.
I understood what distance was when I told you to leave me alone, and you started to.
I understood what distance was when my problems were yours, but yours were not mine.
I understood what distance was when things weren’t a mistake, but just “meant to be” fine.
You tell me life goes on, and people change as easily as places do, but do they?
It’s hard to turn the page, when you know someone won’t be in the next chapter. Can the story still go on?
I have fallen into the trap of finding the right time
To grab that perfect moment, make the most of it and speak it all
I have fallen for the idea of clearing the mess I spread in a month, in a jiffy
I am confidently underconfident
But that’s just me. Aren’t I?
I fear opening up to you, destroying the child in myself, taking your smile away and ripping you into pieces
I fear confronting you, crying out in the open, unsure of all the strength that I do contain
Don’t we cry only when we’ve been strong for a long time?
But let me just tell you, it was never about the right time, but about the right try.
I want to know myself and speak up all loud. I want to scream my problems to you and yet not feel weak. I want to live my life and not smile fake. But here’s the deal :
I’ve stopped wanting and started trying.
I’ve stopped telling myself that I’ll open up when it’s the right time (because it never is)
When it is the right try, the story will go on!</p>

	<h1>how</h1>
	<p>This, is about me.

A girl with the loudest mind and the slightest voice, deepest secrets and the shallowest smiles.

I am a sack of mistakes left unresolved, and I keep adding to the weight, as I bloat myself with remorse.

I’m always trying to be normal, to give myself a break. And I try hard, to fit into this world which is only another mistake.

Excuses have been a part of my life, no matter how hard I try.

Into the depths of my hidden scars, how do you always manage to pry?

There are so many things that I want to tell you, but I was never trained that way. I am a sensible retard, searching for peace, that all your questions take away.

And there’s still so much more that you can take of me?

I only wonder, How.

—

I know you want to know about me.

All about what I hide, who is my ‘someone special’ and what I think about you.

Everybody does, it’s okay.

For now, I am not living my dreams. That’s about it.

Wait.

Maybe this time I have the answers to your questions.

Who am I?

I am an ambivert (but more towards the introvert side) and I am proud to claim of being the happiest person around you. (Believe me)

Why do I call myself happy?

I go crazy on lame jokes and describe humour as a battle of intellects. Isn’t that enough?

What makes me live my life this way?

I believe that I do only that I want to. (False truths? Maybe.)

Does that answer your questions?

It never does.

So here’s the thing, it’s just that..

More than living my dreams, I am busy living my fears.

I fear you and more than that, I fear your questions.

Why do you always ask me ‘What if you fail?’ and not ‘How do you plan to succeed?’

Why do you keep forcing on the fact ‘Why this decision?’, more than ‘How is this way better?’

Isn’t it how we do, than what we do, that makes true good?

I don’t fear answering your questions, and I don’t know how, but I’ll let you into my darkest dreams.

—

Relax, I am not blaming you. I am one among the all of us. I am more into your life than I think about my own. Come on, gossip is life and what’s the fun if you don’t poke your nose into matters that don’t matter at all.

But now that I know the fears I instil and the mistakes I make everyday, I’ve stopped beating myself up.

We don’t come with a book on how to get it right all the time and we do fail sometimes, not because we planned to, but simply because we’re human.

—

Let me just remind you, I feel that there is no-one anywhere who can answer for me these questions and feelings, which in their depths have a life of their own. I have patience in everything unresolved in my heart and I try to love the questions.

The point is to live everything and I’m living the Questions now. Perhaps then some day far into the future, I’ll gradually without even noticing it, live my way to the answers.

P.S. But then there was someone who told me – ‘Are you just very comfortable or very happy?’

And I’m still stuck with only one question and that’s ‘How?’
